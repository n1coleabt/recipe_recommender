Cover a bamboo sushi rolling mat with plastic wrap; set aside. | Lay 1 nori sheet on a work surface, shiny-side down. Place 1/4 rice on nori, spread evenly from edge to edge, about 1/4-inch thick. Flip nori onto the prepared plastic-covered mat. Place 1/4 each yellowtail mixture and cucumber in a line along one short edge. | Roll rice and nori sheet around filling, using the bamboo mat to help. Press roll tightly to form a uniform log. Spread 1/2 tablespoon tobiko in a long thin line across top of roll. Press roll with bamboo mat.

Arrange desired fillings (see below) crosswise just off center of rice. Carefully lift filled edge of nori and roll over filling toward unfilled edge, tucking as you roll.
