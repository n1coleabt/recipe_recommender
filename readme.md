# Recipe Recommender System

Welcome to the **Recipe Recommender System**! This project is designed to help users discover and explore Japanese cuisine by recommending recipes based on user queries. The system scrapes recipe data from the web, processes it, and uses machine learning models to provide personalized recommendations.

## Project Overview

The Recipe Recommender System is a web-based application that allows users to search for Japanese recipes by entering an ingredient or dish name. The system uses web scraping to collect recipe data, processes it, and leverages machine learning models (fine-tuned GPT-2) and FAISS for efficient recipe retrieval. The user interface is built using Streamlit, making it easy to use and interact with.

### Key Features:
- **Web Scraping**: Collects recipe data from AllRecipes: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/17491/world-cuisine/asian/japanese/main-dishes/ 
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and structures the data for machine learning.
- **Machine Learning**: Fine-tunes a GPT-2 model for recipe recommendations.
- **FAISS Integration**: Efficiently retrieves similar recipes based on user queries.
- **Streamlit UI**: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to set up your environment and install the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/n1coleabt/recipe_recommender.git
   cd recipe_recommender
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Pre-trained Models**:
   - The project uses a fine-tuned GPT-2 model and FAISS index. Ensure these are downloaded and placed in the appropriate directories.
   - You can download the models from the Hugging Face Hub or generate them by running the provided scripts.

## Running the Project

Once the installation is complete, you can run the project using the following steps:

1. **Run the Streamlit App Locally**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - After running the above command, Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
   - Open the URL in your web browser to access the Recipe Recommender System.

3. **Enter a Query**:
   - In the web interface, enter an ingredient or dish name (e.g., "gyoza") to get recipe recommendations.
   - The system will display a list of recommended recipes along with their summaries, ingredients, and instructions.

## Running on Streamlit Cloud (RECOMMENDED)
You can also access the Recipe Recommender System directly on Streamlit Cloud without needing to install or run anything locally. The app is already deployed and ready to use at the following link:

Access the Live App:
üëâ Recipe Recommender on Streamlit Cloud

How to Use:
Open the link above in your web browser.

Enter an ingredient or dish name (e.g., "gyoza") in the search box.

The system will display a list of recommended Japanese recipes, including their summaries, ingredients, and instructions.
